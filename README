tag-clusterer. It clusters tags.

Actually, it doesn't. It's just a pair of filters to delexicalise tagged
text, which is then clustered by a word clustering tool (currently, mkcls
only), and then generates a tagset specification (.tsx) file for use with
apertium-tagger.

The input must be tagged -- not analysed -- text in the format used for
supervised training of the tagger. Feed its output to mkcls (play around with
the number of classes it generates), then feed that into mkcls-to-tsx.pl

TODO: semi-lexicalisation would be much more useful. mkcls-to-tsx.pl is ready
for semi-lexicalised input, I just haven't written the script to do that yet.
